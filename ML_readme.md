# Neural Network for Fraud Detection - PoC

## Principle

The principle of this Neural Network is to recognize a fraud in a database of operations. This algorithm has to be as closes as possible to be alongside a quantum computer to 

## Disclaimler

This is a proof of concept, The algorithm performs a 90-95% of success that is not that good but this is in the scope of a hackathon (start404).
So it is not optimized and the use of linear neurons is completely intentionnal for our project wherehas it is not the best solution.

It has to be easy and simple to deploy in 24h.
