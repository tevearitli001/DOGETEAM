# DOGETEAM

Python code which allows to simulate a quantum algorithm execution procedure on the HHL algorithm.
At the end of the simulation, a simulated result is created by the qiskit python library (representing the quantum one) and an approximate solution is also created by the numpy python library.

Then both results are displayed and the efficacity of the quantum simulated result with respect to the true classical one is also computed.

The code relies on the HHL library developped by Qiskit also.
